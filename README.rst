Beamer presentation template for EGI-InSPIRE
============================================

This is a beamer template for EGI-InSPIRE presentations. It's based
on the original EGI template (version 3) available from the following
url: https://documents.egi.eu/public/ShowDocument?docid=44

You will need latex-beamer class to compile it. It should be included 
in your favourite GNU/Linux distribution repositories, but it can be
downloaded from http://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home

The template was based on the EGEE one by Gabriel ZAQUINE, that can
be found in https://edms.cern.ch/document/964536/

The template can be found here:
